			<p>As developers, we are typically very busy at our work - gathering requirements, building prototypes, 
			coding, testing, and once in awhile, writing documentation. But along with the main development, there's a secondary 
			layer of research and development - really just a bunch of mini-projects like parsing and importing data, templates and 
			time-savers - things that need to be worked out because they will be plugged into the main development.
			</p>
			
			<p>Certainly, all of this can just be bundled into getting the job done, as we do have to read up on design patterns we haven't 
			implemented before or frameworks that we haven't used before. But, we should be better prepared for this by developing a mindset of 
			continuous learning and training. Which is why we should all spend time in our coding dojos or sandboxes. That system we have at home 
			that is packed to the rafters with every development environment, framework, templating engine, freebie, or anything else that wasn't 
			nailed down. Here we can work things out so we are ready the next time we get a rush project at work.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Continuously Train</h2>
			
			<p>Just like the martial artist or long distance runner, we have to have a training plan and track our results. That's 
			the only way to make sure we are staying on target and moving towards achieving our goals. For me, that could be 
			making sure I complete a set number of courses at <a href="http://www.lynda.com" target="_blank" title="Lynda.com">lynda.com</a> or 
			at <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/" target="_blank" title="Microsoft Virtual Academy">Microsoft Virtual Academy</a>. It could also 
			mean reading the latest Ruby on Rails book or just building a side project so I have an excuse to write some code.</p> 
			
			<p>It's interesting to find a career where so much of what you do at work you also do at home as a hobby. This is somewhat unique and I don't think it's too 
			common in other industries. To think that your hobby - all of that tinkering and screwing around - is what you get paid to do at work! Now, we are much more 
			professional at work and we do have to meet our deadlines. But, the hobby stuff is the kind of useful play that keeps us engaged and ready to go.</p>
			
			<p>It's like homework. For example, studying mathematics - algebra, trig, calculus - you have a lecture, ask some questions and get assigned homework. You 
			go home and work through the problems and return to class the next day to review. You go over the problems, ask some questions and then move on to the next 
			topic. Eventually, you have an exam and prove how well you know the material.</p>
			
			<p>This is the same for development. You pick a topic - say how to use an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" target="_blank" title="Object Relational Mapper">ORM</a> 
			like Entity Framework. So you find a book on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx" target="_blank" title="Entity Framework">EF</a> and install  
			the framework into Visual Studio and then build a project. You learn some basics about the technology and develop a level of comfort and catalog away in your mind what 
			you have accomplished. And the next time you start a project at work, you have one more option to consider. Can I use the Entity Framework in this project?
			</p>
			
			<h2>The Big Idea</h2>
			
			<p>The big idea - code at work, code at home. Keep up with what's going on in your field. Download and install frameworks and libraries. Develop hobby projects and 
			continuously improve. Build a personal website, read some programing books, follow other developers, check out some conferences to see what's trending.</p>
			
			<p>The internet is a bottomless pit - start at wikipedia on some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming" target="blank" title="Computer Programming">topic</a> 
			and see where you end up.</p>
			
			<h3>Must have:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Blog</li>
				<li>Books (currently reading and some favorites)</li>
				<li>Coding Dojo (you must train every day <strong>padawan</strong>)</li>
				<li>Github Account</li>
				<li>Google+</li>
				<li>LinkedIn Account</li>
				<li>Twitter Account</li>
				<li>Website</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Should follow:</h3>	
			<ul>
				<li>Conferences (good way to see what's trending)</li>
				<li>Current Events, Trends</li>
				<li>Popularity of Programming Languages (<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html" target="_blank" title="TIOBE Index">tiobe</a>)</li>
				<li>Latest Frameworks, Patterns and Tools</li>
				<li>Technical Blogs, Podcasts, Youtube</li>
				<li>User Groups and Meetups</li>
