## On Programming

This project incorporates Angular, Bootstrap, Font Awesome and jQuery to build out a basic site using GitHub Pages. These pages feature some personal thoughts and observations regarding software engineering and craftsmanship. 

The secondary goal for this site is to have a sandbox for exploring the use of GitHub Pages. 

Here is the link to the actual site hosted here at GitHub: **[On Programming](http://dduril.github.io/)**
