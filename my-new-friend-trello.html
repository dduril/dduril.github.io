                <h1>My New Friend Trello</h1>    
                <p>Check it out: <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Trello</strong></a></p>

                <p><strong>Trello</strong> is an awesome tool for organizing just about anything! Honestly, I haven't moved past the creation of boards and cards, but that's 
                the beauty of these tools - use what you need. And when you need to dig a little deeper, then the rest of the features are there waiting for you. You can share lists, 
                pay a little or more for more features, or just sign up for a free account and start making lists of things to do!</p>

                <h3>Web Development Dojo</h3>
                <p>It's a good idea to have a martial arts-style attitude towards programming, where you consistently train and teach yourself new things. Here's an example where 
                there is a weekly or bi-weekly commitment to Googling new frameworks and APIs, finding cool new blogs and newsletters, doing some actual coding and then a little 
                facebooking or tweeting.</p>

                <h3>Summer Yardwork Projects</h3>
                <p>Plan out some fun yard projects - and then just don't do them. Most of the fun is in the planning anyways. Seriously, just about any routine home repair or 
                landscaping project is ideal for a trello board. Equally fun is knocking your way through the list and moving tasks to the right side of the board.</p>

                <h3>Important Television Projects</h3>
                <p>Trello can also be used for that all important list of binge-worthy tv shows. True, Netflix and Amazon Prime give you a queue feature, but it's more fun to see 
                the whole list of shows in one place and count up all those hours you're about to waste.</p>
