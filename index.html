                <h1>Things To Remember</h1>    
                <p>In the course of being a web developer, there are a lot of things to remember. And being a web developer certainly isn't
                getting easier. Every day brings another wave of blogs, newsletters, podcasts, tweets and tutorials on how to do really cool
                things. All of which makes being a web developer fun and rewarding and with plenty of opportunity to try new things or do the 
                same thing differently and continously learn our craft.
                </p>

                <p>
                But, this constant learning of new frameworks and libraries, utilities and tools, patterns and opinions can also bog you down and 
                leave you feeling overwhelmed. And sometimes, in all of this racing to keep up with the latest pattern or framework, you really find yourself
                focused on remembering different date format specifiers or some little bit of syntax, instead of focusing on bigger things - like solving 
                the problem and delivering our solution.
                </p>

                <p>And so, I'd like to focus this site on remembering some of those things - like doctypes, html5 tags and attributes, css3 and media queries, 
                jQuery syntax and properties, database queries and server settings, how to use Github, yeah - and all of those Python, Ruby, Rails, and Node 
                command-line gems with their parameters and switches.
                </p>

                <p>Much of this can be easily found on Google, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" title="Mozilla Developer Network" target="_blank">MDN</a>, 
                <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx" title="Microsoft Developer Network" target="_blank">MSDN</a>, 
                <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" title="Stack Overflow">Stack Overflow</a>  
                and other great sites like <a href="http://alistapart.com/" target="_blank" title="A List Apart">A List Apart</a> and 
                <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank" title="Smashing Magazine">Smashing Magazine</a>. But, I'd also like to contribute my 
                collection of web programming techniques and ideas based on  many years of working in this field.
                </p>

                <p>Then, I can get back to working on the bigger problems knowing that I'll always know where to find that date format specifier.</p>
