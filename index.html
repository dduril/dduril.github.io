                <h1>Things To Remember</h1>  
                  
                <p>In the course of being a Web Developer or now more commonly - Full Stack or Front End Developer - there are a lot of things to remember. Ofcourse, being a developer in any space can be
                overwhelming, for example data engineering or games programming. The proliferation and acceptance of open source software and github have certainly help alot in this regard. It is very easy to quickly find a library or module to help out with your project.</p>
                
                <p>As a Web Developer, I've found this to be especially true. Every day brings another wave of blogs, newsletters, podcasts, LinkedIn articles, tweets and tutorials on how to build truly unique and interesting features into mobile and responsive apps. All of which makes being a developer in the web space a fun and rewarding, if not also, hectic and challenging endeavor with plenty of opportunity to continously learn the craft.
                </p>

                <p>
                But, this constant learning of new frameworks and libraries, utilities and tools, patterns and opinions can also bog you down and 
                leave you feeling overwhelmed. And sometimes, in all of this racing to keep up with the latest pattern or framework, you really find yourself
                focused on remembering different date format specifiers or some little bit of syntax, instead of focusing on bigger things - like solving 
                the problem and delivering our solution.
                </p>

                <p>And so, I'd like to focus this site on remembering some of those things - like doctypes, html5 tags and attributes, css3 and media queries, 
                jQuery syntax and properties, database queries and server settings, how to use Github, yeah - and all of those Java, Python, Ruby and Node 
                command-line gems with their options and parameters.
                </p>

                <p>Much of this can be easily found on Google, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" title="Mozilla Developer Network" target="_blank">MDN</a>, 
                <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx" title="Microsoft Developer Network" target="_blank">MSDN</a>, 
                <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" title="Stack Overflow">Stack Overflow</a>  
                and other great sites like <a href="http://alistapart.com/" target="_blank" title="A List Apart">A List Apart</a> and 
                <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" target="_blank" title="Smashing Magazine">Smashing Magazine</a>. But, I'd also like to contribute my 
                collection of web programming techniques and ideas based on many years of working in this field.
                </p>

                <p>Then, I can get back to working on the bigger problems - knowing that I'll always know where to find that date format specifier.</p>
