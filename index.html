<h1>Things to remember.</h1>

<p>In the course of being a software engineer, I find that there are just too many things to remember. We should be
focused on how to solve problems and deliver solutions. But, so often, I find myself trying to recall
little tidbits of code like the format specifiers for dates.</p>

<p>And so, this site will be a directory of all of those things - doctypes, jQuery syntax, sql basics, how to 
use github, yeah - all those command-line gems with their switches and parameters for linux or rails or node.
</p>

<p>I suppose I could always just google these things, but I'd like to have my own personal spot for these little 
treasures. And, maybe if someone else stumbles upon this site, they can help you too.</p>
